When and Then: The Case Statement
The if/else statement is powerful, but we can get bogged down in ifs and elsifs if we have a lot of conditions to check. Thankfully, Ruby provides us with a concise alternative: the case statement. The syntax looks like this:

case language
when "JS"
  puts "Websites!"
when "Python"
  puts "Science!"
when "Ruby"
  puts "Web apps!"
else
  puts "I don't know!"
end
But you can fold it up like so:

case language
  when "JS" then puts "Websites!"
  when "Python" then puts "Science!"
  when "Ruby" then puts "Web apps!"
  else puts "I don't know!"
end
=end

puts "Hello there! Which language do you speak?"
greeting = gets.chomp

# Add your case statement below!

case greeting
    when "English" then puts "Hello!"
    when "French" then puts "Bonjour!"
    when "German" then puts "Guten Tag!"
    when "Finnish" then puts "Haloo!"
    else puts "I don't know that language!"
end
